# S1.04 - Testing

## Level 1

### Exercise 1
A class to manage a collection of books in a library, with features to add, retrieve, insert and remove books. Unit tests verify correctness, order, duplicates and list size using JUnit.

### Exercise 2
This exercise implements a class that calculates the letter of a Spanish DNI number. A parameterized JUnit test verifies correctness for a predefined set of cases.

### Exercise 3
A method is created to deliberately throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and a JUnit test checks that the exception is correctly thrown.


## Level 2 

### All Excercices
Exercise 1
Assertions that verify when two integers are equal and when they are not, using the fluent syntax of AssertJ.

Exercise 2
Assertions to check whether two object references are the same or different.

Exercise 3
Verifies that two integer arrays are exactly identical in content and order.

Exercise 4
An ArrayList containing mixed object types is tested to confirm insertion order, content presence regardless of order, uniqueness, and absence of a specific element.

Exercise 5
A simple map is created and tested to ensure it contains a specific key.

Exercise 6
A class is created to trigger an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and AssertJ is used to validate that the exception is thrown properly.

Exercise 7
An empty Optional object is created, and an assertion checks that it is indeed empty.


## Level 3

### Exercise 1
A Calculator class is developed using a TDD approach. Unit tests for basic operations are written first, followed by the actual implementation. The cycle of writing,
testing, and refactoring is applied iteratively to grow functionality safely.
